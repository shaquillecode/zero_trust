WHY ZERO TRUST?

The Traditional Networking security approach was built to protect the data center with four high walls. Logically, there is one front door, which is used as the only point for network traffic to come in and go out. The Security guard at the front door will filter the network traffic coming in and out. In this approach the Security guard represents the network middleware appliances securing the data center. Everything inside the walls or network is trusted traffic inside a trusted zone and everything outside the wall is untrusted. Common network middleware appliances are; Firewalls at OSI layer level 4, Web Application Firewalls (WAF) at level 7, Intrusion detection systems, Intrusion prevention systems, & Security information and event management systems. VLAN may also be used to further protect the network by using segmentation. Segmentation will split the network into sub networks and restrict communication between different sub networks. This is the Traditional Perimeter Security Model. Most organizations are a using a mix of cloud services, servers, devices, and organizational units.Traditional Perimeter Security is very difficult to manage in a world of microservices.

BeyondCorp is a security model that allows Google employees to work more securely from any location without the need for a traditional VPN.

The BeyondCorp Zero Trust Model Implementation by Google is logically the same as a Zero Trust Architecture.


We must eliminate the notion of a trusted network (intranet) and an untrusted network (external networks). In Zero Trust, all network traffic is untrusted.
